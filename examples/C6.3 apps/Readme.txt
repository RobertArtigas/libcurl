All App's in this folder was done in Clarion 6.3.
You should be able to open and compile them in any newer Clarion version.
All App's uses the LibCurl Global Template.

1) FTPManager
Simple example client using libcurl as a FTP client.
Well not that simple, it is a full fledged working app that can be used to do all your work.
Handles both FTP and SFTP.

2) TestHTTP
It demonstrates:
a) File Upload via HTTP.
b) File Download via HTTP.
c) Web Services.

3) HTTPDownload (File Download via HTTP)
Contains two App's.
a) HTTPDownloadNoProgress app is very basic with No Progress indicators.
b) HTTPDownloadProgress app is more advanced and have a Progress indicator.

4) HTTPUpload (File Upload via HTTP)
Contains two App's.
a) HTTPUploadNoProgress app is very basic with No Progress indicators.
b) HTTPUploadProgress app is more advanced and have a Progress indicator.

5) WebServices
Demonstrates using Web Services.
PUT, GET, DELETE and POST
Can use both NON Secure and Secure (SSL/TLS) Connections.
Secure Connections supported - TLSv1, SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3(Not Yet Implemented).
If selected to use Secure connections and no secure version is selected libcurl will automatically use the version supported by the server.

6) FTPUpload (File Upload via FTP/SFTP)

Contains two App's.
a) FTPUpload app is very basic with No Debug Information, uses local libcurl control template.
b) FTPUploadDebug app is more advanced and Debug Information also displayed on the screen, uses local libcurl control template, require some Global Embed Code.

7) FTPDownload (File Download via FTP/SFTP)
For SSH connections can handle: Any, PublicKey, Password, Host, Keyboard, Agent.

b) FTPDownloadDebug app is more advanced and Debug Information also displayed on the screen, uses local libcurl control template, require some Global Embed Code.


All App's have been made as simple as possible and easy to follow to allow quick and easy implementation into your own app.
I hope it will help others.

PS: I need to say that it is not me that is this clever.
I have the idea, I do the basic, I add the libcurl stuff/code, I usually mess it up.
Mike then guides me and fix my mistakes.
Thanks Mike.
